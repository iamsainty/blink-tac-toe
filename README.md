## Emoji Categories

Each player picks one category before starting. These are the five options:

- **Animal**
- **Food**
- **Sports**
- **Emoji**
- **Nature**

Each move picks a random emoji from your chosen category.

## How the Vanishing Works

Here’s the fun part:  
Every player can have **only 3 emojis on the board** at a time. When you try to place your 4th one, your **oldest emoji disappears** (like it vanishes — poof). This keeps the board active and unpredictable.

It’s kind of like a moving target. You place one, the oldest one fades out. So your strategy needs to blink with the game too.

## Rules (in short)

1. Both players enter their name and pick different emoji categories.
2. Game starts. Players take turns to place emojis on the 3×3 grid.
3. Each player can have only 3 emojis active.
4. On the 4th move, your first emoji vanishes automatically.
5. First to get 3 in a row (row/column/diagonal) **wins**.
6. Game continues until someone wins — no draws here.
